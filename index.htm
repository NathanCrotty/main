    	<H1>How to Make a Great Website</H1>
	       <H2 class="header">Why I Chose HTML over Wix and Squarespace</H2>
        
        <P>
            <strong>So I was thinking about making a website</strong>
            but I wasn't sure what the best way to do it was. I had heard countless different companies trying to get me to sign up for their
            <em>"Amazing Webiste Maker"</em>
            (
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wix.com/">wix</a>
            and 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.squarespace.com/">squarespace</a>
            most notibly but there are also many others such as 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.godaddy.com/offers/gocentral/website-builder?">godaddy</a>
            , 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clickfunnels.com/">clickfunnel</a>
            , and 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.weebly.com/">weebly</a>
            ) but did you ever stop to wonder what they used to make that website with? You know, the one that's trying to sell you on a monthly subscription and trying to convince you that you're not smart enough to learn to program.<br>
        </P>
        
        <p>
            <br>
            Ok, maybe I'm being a little hard on them, after all they 
            <em>are</em>
            trying to get more people into web design which is a wonderful thing, but I feel like trying to convince them that learning to code is just too hard isn't the way to do that. If you want to learn coding 
            <a target= "_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Acedemy</a>
            or 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3 schools</a>
            are great places to start learning for free, and by learning to program yourself you get all the advantages of making a website yourself with the flexibility of 100% custom html code.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <br>
            So, I notice I've talked a lot about HTML but I haven't really explained what it is very well. HTML is a 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming language</a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <br>
            If you want to start programming html right now then hit the 
        </p>
        
        <img class="wrapped" src="https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/large-black-icons/512/Windows_window_interface_microsoft.png" alt="windows icon" width="30" height="30">
        
        <p>
            icon on your keyboard or in the bottom left corner of your scree and type "notepad" and click on the first result, you will be brought into a text editor, You can write anything in this window.click on 
            <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NathanCrotty/main/master/example.htm" target="_blank">THIS LINK</a>
            ,then copy and paste it in to your notepad window. at this point you can save your notepad project by pushin "Ctrl+S". When save it you will get a message looking like the picture down below. You should set the encoding to "UTF-8", and change the "save as type" to "all files" and name the file "index.html". It does not matter where you save this file to, but it just matters that you save it to somwhere you'll be able to remeber.
        </p>
        
        <img class="image" src="save_example.png" alt="save example">
        
        <p>
            Now you can go to your file explorer, and find where you saved your text file, then right click on the file and you will get a drop down menu, click open with, then click on whichever internet browser you prefer. It should look similar to what's shown down below. 
        </p>
         
        <img class="image" src="example_1.png" alt="example code">
        
        <p>
            
        </p>
        
        <script>
            //JavaScript
            console.log("hey guys!");
        </script>
        
    </body>
