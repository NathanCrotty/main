    	<H1>How to Make a Great Website</H1>
	   <H2 class="header">Why I Chose HTML over Wix and Squarespace</H2>
        
        <P>
            <strong>So I was thinking about making a website</strong>
            but I wasn't sure what the best way to do it was. I had heard countles different companies trying to get me to sign up for their
            <em>"Amazing Webiste Maker"</em>
            (
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wix.com/">wix</a>
            and 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.squarespace.com/">squarespace</a>
            most notibly but there are also many others such as 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.godaddy.com/offers/gocentral/website-builder?">godaddy</a>
            , 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clickfunnels.com/">clickfunnel</a>
            , and 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.weebly.com/">weebly</a>
            ) but did you ever stop to wonder what they used to make that website with? You know, the one that's trying to sell you on a monthly subscription and trying to convince you that you're not smart enough to learn to program.<br>
        </P>
        
        <p>
            <br>
            Ok, maybe I'm being a little hard on them, after all they 
            <em>are</em>
            trying to get more people into web design which is a wonderful thing, but I feel like trying to convince them that learning to code is just too hard isn't the way to do that. If you want to learn coding 
            <a target= "_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Acedemy</a>
            or 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3 schools</a>
            are great places to start learning for free, and by learning to program yourself you get all the advantages of making a website yourself with the flexibility of 100% custom html code.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <br>
            So, I notice I've talked a lot about HTML but I haven't really explained what it is very well. HTML is a
